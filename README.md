# Blaze WP Core <sup>1.0.2</sup>
An object-oriented MVW framework for WordPress themes.

Idea behind Blaze WP Core is move most often used functionality of a WordPress theme into a library that can be reused across different themes. This will allow to:
* avoid code duplication
* roll out functionality updates and fixes without the need to update the theme itself

With Blaze WP Core, a theme can be very thin, responsible for generating page views and having functionality that is specific to the current theme only (a very rare case).

Blaze WP Core integrates with WPML, an excellent WordPress multilingual plugin.
